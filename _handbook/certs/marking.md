## FCC

FCC device classification and marking requirements are generally listed in [Part 15 in the FCC section of the Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15?toc=1).

The requirements for marking are as follows:

- On the Device
  - If the device is an intentional radiator and you had to file with the FCC to acquire an FCC ID, the ID must be visible on the device (or on a screen if the device has one) (from [Part 2.925](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2/subpart-J/subject-group-ECFR491b8ce5b4e7963/section-2.925)).
  - If the device only requires a SDoC, then *optionally* you can affix the FCC mark "as a visual indication that the product complies with the applicable FCC requirements" (from [Part 2.1074](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2/subpart-J/subject-group-ECFR64d0de5de218f0c/section-2.1074)).
  - Some information must be placed on a conspicuous location on a device that requires a SDoC as dictated by [Part 15.19](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15/subpart-A/section-15.19) (most of which will fall under 15.19.a.3).
- Manual
  - Based on if the device is Class A or Class B, [Part 15.105](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15/subpart-B/section-15.105) dictates further notices that must be provided in the manual.
  - Some information must be listed in the manual either an intentional or unintentional radiator as dictated by [Part 15.21](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15/subpart-A/section-15.21).
  - Based on Class A or Class B, the following information must be provided in the manual based on [Part 15.105](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/section-15.105).

## CE

The official site of the European Union has [clear guidelines](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/labels-markings/ce-marking/index_en.htm) on how to affix the CE marking.

In general, the CE mark must:

- be visible, legible, and indelible
- be no shorter than 5mm
- scaled linearly
- be on the product manual or packaging if it cannot be affixed to the product itself
- *not* be used if the product does not *require* a CE mark
