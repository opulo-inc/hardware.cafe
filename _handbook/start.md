## Ethos

Above all else, the advice in this handbook aims to be pragmatic. Shipping hardware is an incredibly difficult task, and much of the time you'll likely be operating with less than ideal circumstances, inefficient processes, and methods that don't scale well at all. But if that's the most pragmatic thing to do at the time, *that's what we recommend*. This is not a purist's guide, or the most optimal and comfortable way of doing things, it's the way that makes hardware happen with the best chance of success.
