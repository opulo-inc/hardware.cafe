# [hardware.cafe](https://hardware.cafe/)

hardware.cafe is a community driven resource for people shipping (or trying to ship) a hardware product. This repository is the source for the site.

It's comprised of:
- the Handbook, which is a written account of how to handle various parts of shipping hardware
- the Forum (still in progress) where folks can discuss the meta and strategies for shipping
- the Blog, where folks can write guest articles about a particular issue or challenge they dealt with

## Contributing

If you have information to add to this site, **please do**! A few notes on contributing:
- If you'd like to write an article or add/edit a section, please first make an issue containing 1) who you are and what your area of expertise is, your background that gives you the knowledge you're contributing, and 2) what you'd like to contribute. This will save you the trouble of writing out a section if it's not likely to be merged.
- Adhere to the existing standard we're following for blog post file management, naming, and formatting.
- Do not add a section to the handbook unless otherwise discussed in an issue.

We want this site to be a community driven resource with _pragmatic, efficient advice_. This is for scrappy teams just trying to make things happen, not for dogmatic die-hards. The best solution is the one that works. Share that solution, not the one from a textbook.
